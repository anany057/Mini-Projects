# Mini-Projects
Mini Projects Created Using Html,Css,Js.

1)Move the Ball: the Player Can Move the Ball in a confined Space in any direction.

2)Catch Me If You Can: The player tries to catch a ball that is moving randomly around the screen. As soon as the player hovers over the ball, it changes its position to a random point on the screen. The player has a limited amount of time to catch the ball before it disappears.

3)5 Digit Up Counter: The user enters a number from 1 to 99999. A timer is then started, and the number on the screen counts up to the entered number. Once the number reaches the entered number, the timer stops.

The reason I created these mini projects was to enhance my JavaScript thinking ability and to enhance them by making changes.


Here are some additional details about each project:

Move the Ball: The ball is initially placed in the center of the screen. The player can move the ball by 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' it in the desired direction.small.

Catch Me If You Can: The ball is initially placed in a random position on the screen. The ball moves randomly around the screen, changing direction every few seconds. The player can catch the ball by clicking on it. If the player catches the ball, they score a point. If the ball disappears before the player catches it, the player loses a point.

5 Digit Up Counter: The user enters a number from 1 to 99999 in the text field. A timer is then started, and the number on the screen counts up to the entered number. Once the number reaches the entered number, the timer stops. The user can reset the timer by clicking on the reset button.
